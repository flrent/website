        If you have started using threads.net, you might find difficult to find users that you already follow on there, on desktop.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
        I created a simple browser extension for Chrome that adds a Threads link on a twitter profile, and opens the same @username on threads.net. If it exists, you can then scan the QR code on your phone and follow that person. If not, it currently 404s.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
        Threads.net doesn't have a public search yet on the web, but once they do, I'll update it to trigger a search instead so even if the user is using a different username, they may be found faster.

        You can give it a try there:
