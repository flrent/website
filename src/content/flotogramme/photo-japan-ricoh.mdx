    <p class="mt-4">In fall 2024 I was on the market for a compact camera that can take better photos than my iPhone 15 Pro, but not as a big as my Sony A7 II.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Ultimately it came down to the Ricoh GR III and the Fujifilm X100VI. Both are (were?) sold out pretty much anywhere, but the Ricoh had my preference because of its smaller size and better autofocus, and a waitlist of only a few weeks.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">The Ricoh GR III is a compact camera but has a phenomenal 24.2 MP APS-C sensor and fast 28mm f/2.8 lens.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">It was a lot of fun capturing cities like Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka with this tiny camera. I will be updating this page as I edit photos from my latest trip.</p>
